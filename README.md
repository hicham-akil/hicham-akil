Hi, I'm Hicham Akil 👋
Web developer

I’m an aspiring Moroccan web developer who enjoys turning ideas into functional, well-structured, and user-friendly web applications. I like building projects from scratch — from understanding requirements, to designing simple systems, to writing clean and maintainable code that solves real problems.

🌱 What I'm Working On
I’m currently improving my web development skills by building real-world projects. My main focus is on backend development with Laravel, full-stack applications with React, and learning more about Node.js and MongoDB. I enjoy understanding how applications work behind the scenes and writing code that is clear, scalable, and easy to maintain.
